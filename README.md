# Night-At-Nymns
(2024) Horror game, 1st place winner of streamer Nymn's $3000 gamejam

Solo developed over 2 months involving 3d modelling, image editing, audio design, music production, programming, and testing.

Set in the streamer's house and based on the exit-like genre, the gameplay involves exploring the house each day and sending sms messsages describing the events that occur. The events become more unsettling each day, culminating in a final jumpscare.

Examples of the events are hearing footsteps coming up the driveway, or the TV turning on by itself and showing a news report of a recent prison escapee in the area.

Warning - this game contains jumpscares

(The desktop background is faithful to the streamer's - no GenAI was used in this, or any of my projects)

## Technologies/Techniques Used:
- Playtesting used to identify bugs and profiling used to optimise
- Lightmapping and mesh optimisation

## Features:
- 10 days each with a different event
- Realistic desktop with story sms messenger, playable minesweeper, taskbar, drag highlighting, and community jokes
- Extensive sound design that builds tension using many sound effects that grow in number as the days progress
- Footstep audio system with multiple surfaces and environments
- A freeroam mode, unlocked after game completion, that allows exploring the house in daylight
- Adjustable volume and camera sensitivity
